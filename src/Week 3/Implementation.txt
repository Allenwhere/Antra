1. Use concurrentHashMap to assure thread safe.

2. recordSongPlays: 
	Use compute method to update add and update values

3. getPlaysForSong:
	Use get method to get the value. If the value is null, return -1,
otherwise just return the value.

3. getTopNSongsPlayed:
	First, make sure the size of the list you're trying to get is less
than the number of the songs existing in the Map.
	Store all the entrySets into an ArrayList
	Sort the arraylist with a new override Comparator(use negative sign
to achieve decending order)
	Based on the number of the top songs we're required to get, add the 
keys of the first n entries in the Arraylist to a new list. Return it.
